# Institute-Analysis-of-student-s-yearly-data

The project aims to create a data visualization dashboard that provides insights into student performance over the years. The dashboard will be created using Microsoft Power BI, which is a powerful tool for data analysis and visualization.

The dashboard will display the following metrics:

Student Attendance
Grades
Exam results
The dashboard will also allow viewers to track enrollment by noting the total number of students and their attendance percentages. The “Examination result by branch” column chart displays students’ exam results by subject. Also, users can track the average score for each subject.

The main screen of the “Student count by grade and gender” widget displays the total number of students by grade. However, as this pie chart uses the multi-level drill-down feature, clicking a bar on the main screen will provide additional information—in this case, the numbers of male and female students by grade. The data can then be drilled down even further: clicking each slice on the grade chart will, in turn, provide the student count by gender.
